- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhhlim
- 👀 I’m interested in IoT automation
- 🌱 I’m currently learning blockchain on edX, maintaining a collections site, and working for a company specializing in Data infrastucture and analytics. I specialize in the automation of processes including BOM automation, proposal documentation, and drag-and-drop visualization using SVG images.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on IoT products for home automation (saving on utility bills) and optimization of resource allocation and climate tech.
