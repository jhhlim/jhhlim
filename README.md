- 👋 Hi, I’m @jhhlim and am an IT Professional with 10 years of experience in BFSI and technology (hardware and software). I specialize in the automation of processes including BOM automation, proposal documentation, and drag-and-drop visualization using SVG images. I have automated storage devices for data infrastructure products such as Virtual Storage Platform and NAS using drag and drop visualization for automation of cabling logic and automation of warehouse instructions used at distribution centers. I also have several years of experience maintaining code in Java, Javascript, node.js, salesforce administration and development, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, bootstrap, FPX CPQ, Callidus cloud, C++/C, Python, and business experience working with product managers, pricing, finance, and sales teams. I am currently working on research and development of new products with a focus on the 4th industrial revolution and connective industries which I believe will grow over the next few decades.
